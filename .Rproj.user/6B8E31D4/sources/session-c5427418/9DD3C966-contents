The main goal of our journal club is to gather students and researchers within the School of Education and Social Sciences, or more broadly, within the University of the West of Scotland, to **form a community of people interested in issues around Open Science and reproducibility**. We will do so by organising regular meetings throughout the academic year, on the **third Wednesday of (almost) every month**. 

During these **hour-long meetings**, we will dive into the latest research on improving transparency, replicability, and reproducibility in science by **reading and discussing a specific paper**. This **informal, come-when-you-can gathering** is perfect for anyone curious about open science practices, and it provides a great chance to explore key topics, share insights, and foster a curious and open community. 

**All are welcome, no prior experience required. Just drop by whenever you can.**
